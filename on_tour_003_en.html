  name: Sebastian Suchanowski
  description: "I am passionate about new technologies with a focus on the mobile world, and am currently putting all of my efforts into the iOS platform. I believe in the Lean Startup movement and am passionate about entrepreneurship and business.

I consider myself a man of action who is more likely doing 3 projects at once than lying around and watching TV (except This Week in Startups). My mind feels most alive when it is brought to the edge of what it can handle. After hours (if any are left) I like to play soccer, jog, and watch a good movie."
