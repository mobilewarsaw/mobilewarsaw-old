  name: Maciej Górski
  description: "Maciej is a passionate developer, but also a conference wanderer: during this year, he spent more time listening (and sometimes speaking) to people during various conferences and meetups on topics mostly related to mobile and Java Eee, than sitting and coding behind his desk. For a couple of months now, he is in love with the new Android API for maps, which resulted in a birth of a small library called Android Maps Extensions. He started his hobby when a series of articles about Pascal \"Nie tylko gramy\" appeared in a computer magazine CD-Action. Apart from programming, he avoids computers and prefers to bike."
